## How to make a clean pull request

- Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
- Clone the fork on your local machine.
- Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull `upstream` changes into it.
- Create a new branch to work on!
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
- Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
- Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote `origin`.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch.
- Target the project's `main` branch!
- Further changes are requested so just push them to your branch.
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes
  from `upstream` to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es).
